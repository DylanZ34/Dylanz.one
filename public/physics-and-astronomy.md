### Quantum Computing
The rapid analysis of the growing number of images acquired by telescopes and interferometers is
critical to discovery in modern astrophysics. While this analysis can be conducted using classical
computational infrastructure, quantum computation promises to substantially accelerate image processing
by being able to analyse many images in parallel, store large amounts of data across relatively small
numbers of qubits, and rapidly apply quantum machine learning algorithms to this data. We analyze two
techniques for representing quantum images, Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and
Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR), as well as quantum algorithms that can be used to
process the data in these quantum images. We show that both the FRQI and NEQR representations could
be useful for astrophysical image processing on future quantum computing hardware. We specifically
highlighted the noise issues of FRQI on existing quantum computing hardware and the higher qubit
counts of NEQR, which could also be limiting on current hardware. My results underscore how quantum
image processing can substantially accelerate the rate of scientific discovery in astrophysics once more
fault-tolerant quantum computers become more freely available.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the brightest and most powerful explosions in the universe, emitting light of the shortest wavelength (gamma rays), and occur when stars collapse into black holes or when neutron stars merge. In the past, several theories have been proposed to explain GRBs while also unifying relativity with quantum mechanics. Among these is loop quantum gravity, which proposes that photons travel slower if they have very high energies. In this paper, we analyze intensity and time data of photons received from GRBs to evaluate the integrity of the loop quantum gravity theory and whether the values it predicts line up with observed data values of photon travel time. We ultimately show that loop quantum gravityâ€™s predictions do not line up with what is observed, and that all light travels at the same speed.
