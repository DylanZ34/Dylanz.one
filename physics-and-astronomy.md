### Quantum Computing
The rapid analysis of the growing number of images acquired by telescopes and interferometers is
critical to discovery in modern astrophysics. While this analysis can be conducted using classical
computational infrastructure, quantum computation promises to substantially accelerate image processing
by being able to analyse many images in parallel, store large amounts of data across relatively small
numbers of qubits, and rapidly apply quantum machine learning algorithms to this data. We analyze two
techniques for representing quantum images, Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and
Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR), as well as quantum algorithms that can be used to
process the data in these quantum images. We show that both the FRQI and NEQR representations could
be useful for astrophysical image processing on future quantum computing hardware. We specifically
highlighted the noise issues of FRQI on existing quantum computing hardware and the higher qubit
counts of NEQR, which could also be limiting on current hardware. My results underscore how quantum
image processing can substantially accelerate the rate of scientific discovery in astrophysics once more
fault-tolerant quantum computers become more freely available.

This architecture allows AI systems to:
- Access and reference specific information from external sources
- Generate more accurate and factual responses
- Reduce hallucinations and improve reliability
- Stay up-to-date with current information

The combination of these technologies is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence, creating more capable and reliable AI systems.
